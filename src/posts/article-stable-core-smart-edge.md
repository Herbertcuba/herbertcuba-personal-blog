There's a conversation happening in every boardroom and Slack channel right now. It goes something like this: "Should we replace our CMS with AI?" And I think that's the wrong question entirely.

I've been building content systems since 2005. Twenty-one years of watching technology waves come and go—from the early days of web content management, through the headless revolution, into the API economy, and now this moment we're in with AI. And here's what I've learned: the companies that survive technological shifts aren't the ones who abandon ship. They're the ones who strengthen the hull and add smarter sails.

**21 years building content systems taught me one thing: those who bet everything on AI without a content strategy will fail. Those who strengthen their foundations and layer intelligence on top will win.**

## The CMS Isn't Dead—It's More Important Than Ever

I get it. When you see what AI can do—generating content, personalizing experiences, automating workflows—it's tempting to think the traditional CMS is a dinosaur. Why maintain structured content when AI can just... figure it out?

Here's my take: that thinking is backwards.

AI isn't replacing your content infrastructure. It's making it exponentially more valuable. Think about it—what does AI need to be useful? Data. Structure. Context. Governance. All the things a well-architected CMS provides.

In my experience, the organizations struggling most with AI adoption aren't the ones with "legacy" systems. They're the ones with no content strategy at all. They've got content scattered across drives, embedded in PDFs, locked in email threads, duplicated across departments. AI can't help you if it doesn't know what you have or where it lives.

Your CMS—that boring, stable, structured system you've been maintaining—is actually your AI readiness score. The cleaner your content model, the more AI can do with it.

## Structure Enables Intelligence

Here's something that took me years to fully appreciate: structure isn't a constraint. It's a multiplier.

When you have properly structured content—with clear schemas, consistent metadata, defined relationships between content types—you're not limiting what's possible. You're enabling it.

Want AI to personalize content for different audiences? It needs to know which content exists, what topics it covers, who it's written for, and how pieces relate to each other. That's metadata. That's content modeling. That's your CMS doing its job.

Want to build a chatbot that actually knows your business? It needs a knowledge base it can trust. Not hallucinated nonsense, but verified, governed content with clear ownership and update cycles. That's content operations. That's editorial workflow. That's your CMS.

I think the phrase "garbage in, garbage out" has never been more relevant. AI amplifies whatever you feed it. Feed it chaos, you get confident-sounding chaos. Feed it well-structured, accurate, governed content, and you get something genuinely useful.

## The Middle Ground: Between "Replace Everything" and "Do Nothing"

In every technology transition, I see organizations split into two camps.

Camp one: "This changes everything! Burn it all down and rebuild from scratch with the new hotness!"

Camp two: "This is overhyped. We'll wait and see. Let's not rock the boat."

Both are wrong, and I've watched both approaches fail spectacularly over the years.

My take? The answer is almost always in the middle—but it's not a passive middle. It's an active, intentional middle. What I call "Stable Core, Smart Edge."

The stable core is your content foundation. Your CMS. Your content model. Your governance. Your editorial processes. The stuff that's been working, that you've invested in, that you understand. Don't throw it away. Strengthen it.

The smart edge is where AI lives. It's the intelligence layer you add on top. Personalization. Recommendation engines. Automated tagging. Content generation assistance. Chat interfaces. Dynamic assembly. All the exciting stuff that AI enables—but built on top of a foundation you control.

This isn't about being conservative or resistant to change. It's about being strategic. AI capabilities will evolve rapidly over the next decade. What works today might be obsolete in two years. But your content? Your brand voice? Your institutional knowledge? Your relationships with your audience? Those are durable assets. Build on bedrock, not sand.

## Pragmatic AI: Start With What You Have

So what does this look like in practice? Here's my honest advice: start boring.

Don't lead with "we need an AI strategy." Lead with "let's audit our content." What do you actually have? Where does it live? Is it structured? Is it current? Who owns it? Can you trust it?

I know that's not as exciting as demos of generative AI creating content from scratch. But in my experience, the organizations getting real value from AI right now—not hypothetical future value, but actual measurable impact—are the ones who did the foundation work first.

Once your content house is in order, the AI applications become obvious. You'll see opportunities everywhere:

- Use AI to improve your content, not replace your content creators
- Automate the tedious parts of content operations, not the judgment calls
- Personalize delivery based on structured audience data
- Build knowledge interfaces that surface your best content at the right moment
- Generate variations and adaptations, with human review and approval

The key word is "layer." AI layers onto your existing investment. It makes what you have more valuable, more accessible, more impactful. It doesn't render your past work irrelevant—it amplifies it.

## The Long Game

I've seen a lot of technology cycles in twenty-one years. The pattern is remarkably consistent: early hype, inflated expectations, painful correction, then genuine long-term value for those who approached it thoughtfully.

We're somewhere between phases one and two with AI right now. The hype is real. So is the potential. But the winners won't be determined by who moves fastest or spends the most. They'll be determined by who builds the smartest foundation.

Stable core. Smart edge. It's not a catchy slogan—it's a strategy that's worked through every technological transition I've witnessed. I'm betting it'll work through this one too.

Your CMS isn't dead. It's not even dying. It's waiting to become the foundation for something much more powerful.

The question isn't whether to replace it. The question is: how strong is your foundation?
