Every week, I see another announcement about some company "going all-in on AI," usually accompanied by a press release about a Chief AI Officer appointment, a multi-million dollar platform deal, and a vague promise to "transform every aspect of the business." And every time, I think the same thing: this is going to be a very expensive lesson in organizational inertia.

I've been a Tech Director long enough to watch several transformation waves wash over enterprises—cloud, agile, microservices, DevOps—and the pattern is always the same: top-down mandates create impressive PowerPoint presentations but rarely change how people actually work. The executives get their innovation theater, the consultants get their fees, and eighteen months later everyone quietly moves on to the next big thing while the previous initiative gets filed under "lessons learned."

My take is that AI transformation needs to work differently, not because AI is magically special, but because the technology is finally mature enough to meet people where they are—if we let it. What I'm proposing here is what I call the "Middle-Out" approach: instead of waiting for the grand unified AI strategy to descend from the C-suite, Tech Directors can start building real, governed AI capabilities today by focusing on small loops that deliver validated change.

## The Problem with Top-Down AI Transformation

The typical top-down approach goes something like this: leadership decides AI is strategic, they hire consultants to identify "use cases," someone builds a prioritization matrix, and eventually a big platform gets procured. Then the platform team spends a year building "foundational capabilities" while the business waits. By the time anything is ready to deploy, the world has moved on, the original champions have left, and the whole thing quietly becomes shelfware.

In my experience, this happens because top-down transformation optimizes for the wrong things—it optimizes for comprehensiveness, for alignment, for risk mitigation—when what actually drives change is momentum. People don't change how they work because someone showed them a strategy deck; they change because they tried something that made their life easier and they want more of it.

The Middle-Out approach flips this entirely: instead of trying to boil the ocean, you identify three or four high-value workflows that your teams already do every day, you build tight feedback loops around automating them, and you let success create demand. The strategy emerges from what works, not from what was planned.

## The Three Core Workflows to Agentize

If I were advising a Tech Director starting this journey tomorrow, I'd tell them to focus on exactly three workflows to begin with, not because these are the only valuable ones, but because they're common enough to be familiar, impactful enough to create believers, and contained enough to govern safely.

**Meeting → Decision Memo.** Every leadership team spends enormous energy in meetings, and most of that value dissipates the moment people walk out the room because nobody has time to write up what was actually decided. An AI agent that takes meeting transcripts and produces structured decision memos—who decided what, with what rationale, and what follow-ups are needed—sounds simple but transforms organizational memory. Suddenly decisions are traceable, context is preserved, and three months later you can actually find out why something was done.

**Lead → Content Brief.** Marketing and sales teams spend shocking amounts of time researching prospects, synthesizing insights, and creating customized content briefs that describe how to approach a specific opportunity. This is exactly the kind of synthesis work where AI excels: take structured data from your CRM, combine it with unstructured research from the web, and produce a brief that would have taken a human three hours in about three minutes. The human still decides what to do with the brief, but they start from a much better foundation.

**Requirement → Prototype.** This is the one closest to my heart as someone who lives in the technology world: taking business requirements and producing working prototypes, not production code, but something tangible enough to validate whether the requirement makes sense. I've watched countless projects go sideways because everyone agreed on the words in a requirements document but had completely different mental models of what those words meant. When you can show someone a working prototype in days instead of months, those misunderstandings surface early enough to fix.

The key insight across all three is that you're not replacing humans—you're moving them up the value chain, from doing the mechanical synthesis work to making decisions about what the synthesis means.

## The Governance Loop Pattern

Now, I know what some of you are thinking: "This sounds great, but what about governance? What about risk? What about the eighteen things Legal and Compliance will say when I tell them AI is making decisions?" And you're right to think about this—ungoverned AI is a liability waiting to happen. But I think governance doesn't have to mean gatekeeping; it can mean feedback loops.

The pattern I recommend is simple: every AI-generated artifact goes through a human review step, every human correction gets captured and fed back into the system, and every week you look at what corrections are being made and why. This creates what I call a "governed loop"—the AI gets better because humans are teaching it, humans stay in control because they're reviewing outputs, and the organization learns what kinds of AI assistance actually work for their specific context.

Practically, this means your Meeting → Decision Memo workflow includes a step where an executive reviews and edits the memo before it gets distributed, and those edits become training signal. Your Lead → Content Brief workflow includes a step where the sales rep accepts, modifies, or rejects the brief, and you track those decisions. Over time, you're not just deploying AI—you're building organizational muscle for working with AI.

## Measuring Validated Change

One of the traps I see teams fall into is measuring tool adoption instead of outcomes—tracking how many people logged into the AI platform this week as if that tells you anything about value created. In my experience, this leads to perverse incentives where the platform team spams people to log in so their metrics look good, while actual utility remains unclear.

What I recommend instead is measuring "validated change"—looking at whether the workflows you're targeting are actually producing better outcomes. For Decision Memos, are decisions getting implemented more consistently? For Content Briefs, is sales cycle time decreasing? For Requirement Prototypes, are you catching misalignments earlier and reducing rework downstream?

These are harder metrics to gather than login counts, but they're the metrics that matter. And honestly, if you can't articulate what outcome you're trying to improve, you probably shouldn't be building the workflow yet.

## Practical Steps for Tech Directors

If I were to distill this into a playbook, here's what I'd suggest:

First, identify one workflow from each of the three categories—or similar workflows from your own context—and find one team willing to experiment. Don't try to boil the ocean; find your believers and let them prove the concept.

Second, build the governance loop into the workflow from day one. Every AI output gets reviewed, every human correction gets logged. This isn't bureaucracy; it's learning infrastructure.

Third, measure what matters. Define the outcome you're trying to improve before you deploy anything, track it honestly, and be willing to admit when something isn't working.

Fourth, tell the story. When something works, make sure leadership knows, not because you need credit, but because success stories create organizational permission for others to try.

## Common Objections and Responses

I'll close with the three objections I hear most often.

"This is too small—leadership wants a comprehensive strategy." My response: show them the results. Small wins compound into strategic advantage faster than big plans that never ship. The strategy is "validated change through governed loops," and the evidence is workflows that measurably improve.

"We don't have the platform infrastructure for this." You probably do—most of these workflows can start with commercial AI tools and simple integrations. Don't wait for the perfect platform; start learning with the tools you have.

"What about data security and compliance?" This is where the governance loop earns its keep. By keeping humans in the review step and logging everything, you maintain the audit trail that compliance needs while building practical experience with what works.

The biggest shift I've seen in my career is this: AI has become good enough that the limiting factor is no longer technology—it's organizational willingness to experiment. The Middle-Out approach is designed to lower the barrier to that experimentation by focusing on specific, governed, measurable workflows that create believers one success at a time.

Start small. Learn fast. Let success create demand.
