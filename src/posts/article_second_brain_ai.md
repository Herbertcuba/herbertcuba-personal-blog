"Human brains were never designed for storage but for thinking."

When I first heard Nate B. Jones say this in his video about building a second brain, something clicked. Not because it was a new idea—I've been running my own second brain in Notion for years—but because the timing suddenly makes sense. We're entering an era where this isn't just good advice for productivity nerds. It's becoming essential infrastructure.

Let me explain.

## My Note-taking Journey (And What I Got Wrong)

I started using Notion around 2020, during that period when the world slowed down and we all had time to think about how we think. At first, I treated it like a fancy note-taking app. I dumped everything in there: meeting notes, article highlights, project ideas, random thoughts at 2 AM about why CMS architectures are fundamentally broken.

The result? Chaos. Beautiful, interlinked chaos.

I had thousands of notes. I religiously used backlinks. I built elaborate folder structures, then abandoned them, then rebuilt them. I tried every plugin imaginable. My vault became a graveyard of half-finished systems.

Sound familiar?

The breakthrough came when I stopped thinking of my second brain as a filing cabinet and started thinking of it as a conversation partner. Not a place to store information—my actual brain could never retrieve it anyway—but a place to think *with*. A surface for ideas to collide and connect.

Here's what I learned: notes aren't valuable because they preserve knowledge. They're valuable because writing them forces you to process knowledge. The act of translating a fuzzy thought into text is where the real learning happens. The note itself is almost a byproduct.

Once I embraced this, my whole relationship with note-taking changed. I stopped worrying about the perfect structure. I started writing messier, more honest notes. And paradoxically, they became more useful.

## Then Came the AI Agents

Here's where 2026 comes into the picture.

For years, AI assistants were standalone tools. You'd prompt them, they'd respond, and that was that. Each conversation started from zero. No memory. No context. Just raw capability waiting to be directed.

But we're now entering the age of AI agents—systems that can maintain context, work across sessions, and actually *know* things about you and your work. And here's the thing about agents: they're only as good as the context they have access to.

Think about it. When I work with an AI on a project, the difference between a useful response and a generic one comes down to one thing: how much relevant context I can provide. And context isn't just "here's my current document." It's "here's how we approach CMS migrations at my company, here's what we learned from the last three projects, here's our philosophy on decoupled architectures, here's who the stakeholders are and what they care about."

That's not a prompt. That's a second brain.

My take? 2026 marks a turning point. The tools are finally mature enough—both the personal knowledge systems and the AI agents—that the combination becomes transformative. Your second brain isn't just *for you* anymore. It's *for your AI*.

## The Enterprise Parallel: CMS as Organizational Memory

Working as Tech Director consultant at Umain and partner at Eidra, I see the same pattern playing out at the organizational level. A content management system isn't just a website publishing tool. It's an organization's collective second brain—or at least it should be.

Most companies treat their CMS like I first treated note-taking: as a filing cabinet. Content goes in, content comes out, and nobody thinks much about the connections, the context, the institutional knowledge embedded in how things are structured.

But here's what's fascinating: as we help companies integrate AI into their digital platforms, the organizations that have well-structured, thoughtfully connected content are miles ahead. Their AI features work better because there's actual context to work with. The CMS becomes more than a repository—it becomes an operational knowledge layer that AI can leverage.

In my experience, the organizations that get this right will have a compounding advantage. Those that don't will wonder why their AI implementations feel shallow.

## What I'd Do Differently

If I were starting my second brain today, with what I know now, here's what I'd change:

**Write for future AI, not just future me.** This doesn't mean writing in a weird, robotic way. It means being explicit about context. Why did I make this decision? What was the situation? What alternatives did I consider? Future AI assistants working with these notes will benefit from the same clarity that future-me would.

**Focus on connections, not categories.** The folder structure doesn't matter. The tags barely matter. What matters is links—explicit connections between ideas. This is what makes a second brain searchable by concept, not just keyword.

**Capture the thinking, not just the conclusion.** A note that says "we chose option B" is nearly useless. A note that explains the reasoning behind choosing option B is a thinking tool forever.

**Regular reviews beat perfect capture.** Spending 30 minutes each week revisiting and connecting recent notes beats spending hours perfecting your capture workflow.

## The Question for 2026

Here's what I keep coming back to: if AI agents become our primary interface for working with information—and I think they will—then the quality of your second brain becomes the quality of your AI.

An AI without context is just a very sophisticated autocomplete. An AI with access to your accumulated thinking, your decision history, your mental models? That's a partner.

So the question isn't whether to build a second brain. It's whether your second brain is ready for what's coming. Are you building a filing cabinet, or are you building a context layer for a new kind of collaboration?

I know which one I'm betting on.
