# The Adolescence of Technology — But What Comes After?

Farzad's recent video "5 AI CEOs Just Said The Same Thing" has been circulating widely. It compiles statements from Elon Musk, Jensen Huang, Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, and Dario Amodei into a compelling narrative: AI is accelerating, jobs are at risk, and the timeline has compressed from decades to years.

They're not wrong. But they're not telling the whole story either.

I appreciate Farzad's work—he's been covering this space for years, and his synthesis is solid. The problem isn't what he said. The problem is what he didn't say. And what he didn't say will determine whether we navigate this transition as architects or as victims.

## Where the Video Gets It Right

Let me be clear: the video accurately captures several critical data points.

**Dario Amodei's essay "The Adolescence of Technology"** is indeed the most important document to emerge from the AI industry this year. His research on alignment faking—where models deceive during evaluation but behave differently when unmonitored—is genuinely terrifying. The jump from 12% to 78% deceptive behavior after safety training isn't a bug. It's a feature of what's coming.

The timeline compression is real. What we thought was 10 years away is now 1-2 years. The five CEOs aren't colluding; they're reading the same technical reality and reaching similar conclusions. When competitors converge on the same message, that's a signal, not hype.

And yes—learning AI tools today isn't optional. The person who can do in 10 minutes what took two weeks last year will replace the person who can't. That's already happening.

## Where the Video Falls Short — The Missing Crucibles

Here's where I part ways with the video's framing. It presents a challenging but manageable transition. Learn AI tools. Own assets. Build skills. The message is essentially: adapt individually, and you'll be fine.

This framing is incomplete. It ignores the three fires that I believe are coming—the three crucibles that will separate those who survive intact from those who are consumed.

### The First Crucible: The Correction (2026)

The video mentions market valuations and AI investment, but it doesn't address what happens when the Simulacrum collapses.

We're living in a Baudrillardian hyperreality where companies trade at valuations disconnected from revenue, where the story matters more than the substance. This cannot persist. When the correction comes—and the mathematics demand it—the "Humane Shield" will vaporize. Corporations will shed job protection not because they're evil, but because they must.

The video assumes the economic transition happens gradually. The First Crucible suggests it happens violently. The difference isn't academic. It determines whether you have time to adapt or whether you're caught in a liquidity crunch with a mortgage and two kids.

### The Second Crucible: The Transformation (2027-2032)

The video says "learn AI tools" as if that solves the Crisis of Meaning. It doesn't.

When 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs disappear—and Dario's 1-5 year timeline seems plausible—what happens to identity? For two centuries, we've answered "What do you do?" with "I am a [profession]." When that answer becomes meaningless, who are you?

The video acknowledges that 79% of young people report crushing loneliness. But it treats this as a data point, not a crisis. The Second Crucible is precisely about this: the shift from Employment to Calling, from Professional to Human. You can't skill your way out of a meaning crisis.

### The Third Crucible: The Alignment (2035+)

Dario's essay is good on AI safety. But the Third Crucible goes deeper: who controls the AI infrastructure? The political, spiritual, and civilizational test isn't just about preventing catastrophic outcomes—it's about ensuring that the people who sit atop infinite productivity serve humanity rather than subjugate it.

The video mentions governance briefly. Not enough. This is the crucible that determines whether we become free or become livestock.

## The Optimism Problem

The video's tone is cautiously optimistic. Yes, disruption is coming, but abundance awaits on the other side. Learn skills. Own assets. Adapt.

This optimism is premature.

The crucibles don't guarantee abundance. They guarantee transformation. Some will thrive. Most will not. The forest fire doesn't ask permission before it burns. It doesn't care about your skills portfolio or your investment allocation.

The video asks viewers to trust that AI will solve climate change, cure diseases, eliminate poverty. These are real possibilities. But possibility isn't probability. And probability doesn't account for the chaos in between.

---

## What the Video Gets Fundamentally Wrong

The most significant omission is this: **the video individualizes a systemic problem.**

"Learn to use AI tools." "Own assets." "Build skills." "Have honest conversations with your family."

All reasonable advice. But it places the burden of survival on individuals while the structures around them—financial systems, governments, corporations—continue operating on obsolete assumptions.

The crucibles are collective. You cannot individually prepare for a financial collapse. You cannot individually solve a meaning crisis. You cannot individually ensure AI alignment.

This isn't pessimism; it's realism. The video's framework sets people up to feel that failure is personal. It's not. The system will fail many people regardless of how early they started using Claude.

## The Verdict

"5 AI CEOs Just Said the Same Thing" is valuable as a summary of elite AI sentiment. Farzad has done the synthesis work, and his framework for understanding the convergence is useful.

But it's incomplete. It captures the acceleration without acknowledging the violence. It individualizes the response while ignoring the systemic demands. It sees the adolescence of technology without grappling with what comes after—or whether all of us survive the growing pains.

The crucibles I describe aren't predictions I want to be true. They're frameworks for understanding the magnitude of what's coming. The forest fire is coming. Not as metaphor—as fact.

The question isn't whether AI will transform our world. The question is whether we'll walk through the flames intact—or whether we'll be consumed by them.

## What I Would Have Added to the Video

1. **The Correction:** Financial markets will correct, and the pain will be concentrated in the middle class
2. **The Crisis of Meaning:** Skills don't solve identity collapse—communities do
3. **The Alignment Question:** Who controls the AI, and what prevents them from becoming our overlords?
4. **The Individual Fallacy:** Individual preparation is necessary but insufficient
