1971 wasn't just "a historical detail." It was a regime change.

When the US abandoned gold convertibility, money became fundamentally more elastic. That single shift rewired the incentive structure of the modern economy: **liquidity cycles started to matter as much as productivity**, and the biggest winners became those who owned scarce assets (and could borrow against them).

If your personal thesis is "grow wealth aggressively while staying on the right side of AI disruption," then understanding the post‑1971 regime gives you a sharper filter for what to own, what to avoid, and why timing suddenly matters.

## The core idea: money became a policy instrument

In a fiat regime:
- money supply becomes political and reactive
- credit creation matters as much as savings
- risk assets often move with liquidity conditions

That doesn't mean "everything is fake." It means the scoreboard changed.

## Three second-order effects that matter for your investing

### 1) Asset inflation can outrun CPI for decades

One of the most confusing features of the last 40–50 years is:
- wages feel sluggish
- CPI might be "stable enough"
- yet **stocks and property go vertical over long horizons**

Why: not because the assets got magically better, but because **discount rates + credit availability** are the hidden hand.

### 2) Real estate becomes a monetary instrument

In many developed markets, property isn't just "housing." It behaves like:
- a leveraged bet on money conditions
- plus a local scarcity bet (zoning, desirability, demographics)

In practice, this is why real estate has been such a wealth engine for people who:
- can access leverage safely
- can hold through cycles
- buy in supply-constrained areas

### 3) The danger signal is policy whiplash

The real risk in a fiat regime is not slow change — it's **fast regime change**:
- rapid rate increases
- credit tightening
- sentiment flips

When rates rise quickly, leverage flips from tailwind to headwind.

## Apply this to you (Kruthusbacken 80)

You don't need to predict macro perfectly. You need a **sell/hold playbook**.

### A simple 3-scenario memo (write this as a 1-pager)

**Scenario A: rates down (tailwind returns)**
- implication: buyers regain affordability → prices stabilize/up
- action: hold longer if rent/financing is manageable

**Scenario B: rates flat (grind + selection)**
- implication: location and quality matter more → "average" stagnates
- action: renovate/position, then sell into pockets of demand

**Scenario C: rates up again (liquidity shock)**
- implication: transaction volumes drop, buyers vanish temporarily
- action: sell earlier if you're near your profit target; avoid being forced

### Your decision trigger (the most important part)

Define 1–2 hard triggers:
- "If rates move X and my cost of capital crosses Y, I sell."
- "If comparable sales in the area drop below Z, I stop waiting for the perfect top."

## The investing meta-lesson

Post‑1971, the biggest advantage isn't IQ. It's:
- owning scarce assets
- managing leverage
- and having a plan for regime changes

The game changed in 1971. Make sure you're playing by the new rules.
