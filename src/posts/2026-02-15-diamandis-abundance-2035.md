*Reflections on Peter Diamandis's "Solve Everything" manifesto, from a Swedish tech leader's perspective*

---

I've been thinking a lot about Peter Diamandis lately.

His recent manifesto "AI's Mission: Solve Everything" isn't just another optimistic tech essay. It's a wake-up call that resonates deeply with what I'm seeing on the ground in enterprise technology — and it terrifies and excites me in equal measure.

Here's the core insight that keeps me up at night: **we have roughly 18 months to set the trajectory for the next century.** That's not hyperbole. That's the window before intelligence becomes so abundant that the patterns we establish now will lock in, just like the QWERTY keyboard locked in an inefficient typing layout 150 years ago because that's what people learned first.

## Intelligence Is About to Flow Like Oil

Diamandis uses a metaphor that clicked something in my head: "Intelligence is about to flow like oil."

In my experience working with CMS platforms and enterprise architecture over the past decade, I've watched technology go through similar phase shifts. We went from monolithic systems where everything was coupled and controlled, to composable architectures where intelligence could be distributed. It was painful. It required rethinking everything. But the organizations that made that shift early? They're the ones thriving now.

AI is doing the same thing — but at a civilizational scale.

GPUs are the new oil wells. Data centers are the new refineries. And superintelligence? That's the energy that will power everything from healthcare to transportation to how we create and consume content. Demis Hassabis predicts we'll solve chronic disease within a decade. Dario Amodei believes we can double human lifespan in the same timeframe.

From my Swedish perspective, this is fascinating. Europe has historically approached new technologies with caution — regulation first, innovation second. There's wisdom in that. But there's also risk. While we're debating AI governance frameworks, the infrastructure is being built elsewhere. The refineries are going up in other regions.

My take: we need both the caution and the urgency. The challenge is holding them together.

## The Muddle — Bureaucracy's Seductive Trap

Here's where Diamandis's thinking really hits home for me.

He warns about what he calls "The Muddle" — a future where we have access to superintelligent systems but waste them on trivial problems. Where bureaucracy consumes AI's potential on optimizing spreadsheets and generating quarterly reports rather than solving actual human challenges.

I see this risk every single day in enterprise tech.

In my work with enterprise clients on CMS transformation, I see organizations facing a choice: use AI to genuinely reimagine how they create value, or use it to make their existing inefficiencies slightly faster. Most choose the latter. It's safer. It doesn't require rethinking job descriptions or power structures. But it's also how you get left behind.

In my experience leading digital transformation initiatives, the hardest part is never the technology. It's convincing people that "The Muddle" isn't progress — it's a trap. Making a broken process 20% faster with AI isn't transformation. It's putting a rocket engine on a bicycle and calling it a spaceship.

The QWERTY analogy haunts me here. We're establishing patterns right now — in how we deploy AI, in what we ask it to do, in the organizational structures we build around it — that will be incredibly difficult to change later. Once people learn a system, once infrastructure is built around assumptions, lock-in happens. And then we're stuck optimizing the wrong things for decades.

## The Digital Singularity Shift

I've been developing a framework I call "The Digital Singularity Shift" that speaks directly to this moment. The core insight is that AI isn't just another tool — it represents a fundamental phase change in how value is created and delivered.

Consider content creation, which is my domain. The old model was simple: hire experts, create content, publish through controlled channels, measure engagement. AI disrupts every single step. Content can be generated, personalized, and delivered at scales that would have seemed absurd five years ago. The interface itself becomes disposable — generated on demand for each user, each context.

In this world, data and content become king in a way they never were before. The strategic asset isn't your CMS or your publishing workflow. It's your unique data, your authentic perspective, your ability to connect meaningfully with people who are drowning in AI-generated noise.

This connects directly to what Diamandis is saying. AI will solve the math, and that unlocks physics, then chemistry, then biology. In the content world, AI will solve the production, and that unlocks... what? This is the question leaders should be asking.

My answer: it unlocks authenticity, purpose, and human connection as the scarcest resources. Generation Z doesn't mourn the mainstream — they want content that means something, from people who mean what they say. AI abundance makes human authenticity more valuable, not less.

## What European Tech Leadership Looks Like Now

From where I sit in Stockholm, I see a particular opportunity and responsibility.

We have strong engineering talent, a tradition of human-centered design, and cultural values around sustainability and social welfare that could genuinely shape how AI abundance gets deployed. But we also have a tendency toward consensus-building that can become paralysis when speed matters.

My take is that European tech leaders need to embrace what I'd call "urgent pragmatism." Yes, we should care about governance and ethics and fair distribution of AI benefits. But we need to care about these things *while building*, not *instead of building*. The philosophical frameworks matter — but they matter most when they're implemented in actual systems serving actual people.

Diamandis talks about AI solving food, energy, education, and health by 2035. I want European companies and thinkers at that table, shaping how those solutions get deployed. Not catching up five years later wondering why American and Chinese systems don't reflect our values.

This isn't about competition for competition's sake. It's about ensuring that when intelligence flows like oil, it flows toward problems that matter to all of humanity — not just the problems that generate returns for whoever built the refineries first.

## The Strategic Question for Every Leader

Here's what I keep asking myself, and what I'd challenge any tech leader to consider:

Are you directing AI toward solving real challenges, or are you letting it optimize your current muddle?

The honest answer for most organizations — including ones I've worked with — is that we're drifting toward the muddle. We're using AI to make existing processes marginally better rather than rethinking what processes should exist at all.

The transformation I'm working on with a major enterprise client — migrating from legacy CMS architecture to an intelligent content infrastructure — is my small attempt to point in a different direction. Not just making content management faster, but rethinking what content management means when intelligence is abundant.

The work isn't glamorous. It's stakeholder meetings and migration strategies and convincing skeptical executives that change is worth the risk. But it's also the work that determines whether we end up in abundance or in the muddle.

## Looking at 2035

Diamandis's vision of 2035 — where chronic disease is solved, energy is abundant and clean, poverty is addressed through AI-optimized resource allocation, and geography no longer determines opportunity — sounds utopian. I've learned to be skeptical of utopias.

But here's what I know: the distance between that vision and our current reality will be determined by the decisions being made right now. Not in ten years. Now.

Every CMS migration, every AI deployment strategy, every organizational choice about where to point these increasingly powerful systems — they're all votes for a particular future.

I want to vote for abundance. But I also know that abundance requires intention. It requires people willing to look past the immediate quarterly targets and ask what we're actually building toward.

The next 18 months will define the next century. The question is whether we'll be architects of that definition, or passengers who wake up surprised by where we've arrived.
