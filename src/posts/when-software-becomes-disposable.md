Something extraordinary happened in 2024. Cursor's team built a functional browser in one week. Chrome took two years and hundreds of engineers to reach the same milestone.

This isn't a story about one tool being better than another. It's evidence of a fundamental inversion: **the cost of generating code has collapsed toward zero.**

But here's what hasn't changed: the cost of attention. Someone still needs to understand what was built, verify it works, and decide if it matters. Production got cheap. Judgment stayed expensive.

## Two kinds of disposable

"Disposable software" sounds like one thing. It's actually two—with very different implications.

**The first kind is democratization.** A product manager builds a quick internal tool. A designer prototypes without waiting for engineering. A student creates something that solves their specific problem. These throwaway personal apps are genuinely good. They expand who can create.

**The second kind is dangerous.** When disposability infects products people depend on, features become volatile. Updates arrive not because they're better, but because shipping is frictionless. The UI you learned yesterday changes today.

## What enterprises actually buy

Here's something the move-fast crowd often misses: **CIOs don't buy speed. They buy certainty.**

When you're running mission-critical systems, calm is the product. Predictability isn't boring—it's premium.

## Glass boxes, not black boxes

As we shift from reactive chatbots to proactive agents, autonomy becomes risk. Trust must be designed through visibility: show the reasoning trail, display the plan before execution, and make the "why" as visible as the "what".

## The pause

A new interaction pattern is emerging: **review-to-approve.**

Designers are learning to create deliberate friction—moments where humans must engage before things proceed.
