Most CMS migrations fail (or turn political) because they are framed as a single massive project: one deadline, one cutover, one "big decision."

A better model is a **portfolio of bets**:
- ship the highest-value journeys first,
- validate with metrics,
- then compound.

This reduces risk, increases stakeholder confidence, and keeps the program aligned to outcomes.

## The core reframing

**Don't migrate pages. Migrate capabilities.**

Capabilities are things the business cares about:
- launching campaigns
- publishing localized content
- improving conversion journeys
- maintaining SEO integrity

Pages are just artifacts.

## The portfolio model

Pick 3–5 "bets" (journeys) and treat each like a product experiment:

1) Hypothesis
2) Build
3) Release
4) Measure
5) Iterate

Examples for Unit4:
- product pages → demo request
- industry landing pages → content downloads
- region-specific (Sweden) SEO pages

## Why this works (and big-bang doesn't)

Big-bang migrations optimize for:
- scope completion

Portfolio migrations optimize for:
- **confidence and momentum**

You get early wins, prove the stack, and build political capital.

## Governance as a product

Governance is not a meeting. It's a system:
- roles/permissions
- audit trails
- quality checks
- accessibility
- SEO hygiene

In the portfolio model, governance is implemented incrementally and tested on real traffic.

## Metrics that unlock buy-in

Baseline and track:
- lead time (idea → live)
- % self-served by editors
- incident rate (broken pages)
- conversion rate (per journey)
- localization cycle time

**When metrics improve, resistance drops.**

## 30 / 60 / 90 day plan

### 0–30 days
- baseline current cycle time + pain points
- define target journeys
- define measurement plan

### 30–60 days
- build foundation (content model, environments, preview)
- ship Bet #1 (Sweden-first if relevant)

### 60–90 days
- ship Bet #2 and #3
- finalize decommission plan
- publish repeatable playbook

## The meta-lesson

The best migrations don't feel like migrations. They feel like product launches.

When you ship value incrementally and measure what matters, stakeholders stop asking "when will it be done?" and start asking "what should we build next?"

That's when you know you've won.
